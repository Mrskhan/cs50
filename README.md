# CS50
This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets of Harvard CS50 course.
These are not very efficient as I am in a learning phase.


## PSET1
1. Mario less

    Output should be:

    __Height: 4__
    
          #  
         ##
        ###
       ####
       
    Where height should be given by user.

2. Mario more

    Output should be:
    
    __Height: 4__
    
           #  #
          ##  ##
         ###  ###
        ####  ####
      
      
     Where height should be given by user.

3. Cash

    A program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.

4. Credit

    A program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of eachâ€™s format. 

## PSET2
1. Readability
2. Caesar
3. Substitution

## PSET3
1. Plurality
2. Runoff
3. Tideman

### Short lecture task
Collatz conjecture
